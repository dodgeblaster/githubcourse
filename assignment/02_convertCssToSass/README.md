We will be walking thru this assignment as a class. We will be taking an existing project with css
and converting it over to Sass.

I will be marking on the following:

-   does the project have variables
-   does the project have nesting
-   does the project have the sass broken up into modules
-   does the project have extended classes
-   does the project have mixins
