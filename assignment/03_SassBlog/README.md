### Suggested Strategy

The following things should be done before anyone makes a branch on github:

-   1. One person should setup the Git repo and invite all others as collaborators
-   2. One person should setup the project with npm, gulp and sass
-   3. One or more people should decide on the design, color scheme and font
-   4. Once that is decided, one person should setup the sass variables based on the design

Once all of those things are done, it is easy to branch off the master branch
and work on different aspects of the site without too much fear of merge conflicts. For example:

-   1 person could work on the Header for all pages
-   1 person could work on the Footer for all pages
-   1 person could work on blog link component
-   1 person could work on the employee bio component
-   1 person could work on the blog page

One suggestion would be to make tasks in Github Projects and have everyone take a task. This will help make sure no one is doing the same thing.
How this assignment will be marked

1. Is there a homepage listing blogs or articles, a details page, and an about page?
2. Is there social icons somewhere on the site (footer, header, pinned to the side)?
3. Are Sass variables being used?
4. Are Sass styles nested based on component?
5. Are UI components broken out into different Sass files?
6. Is there at least 1 mixin in the project?
6. Is indentation correct for HTML and Sass?
7. Is the code free of any merge conflicts?
8. Is the site responsive (can I see everything no matter what width the browser is at)?
9. Is the site hosted somewhere (AWS or Netlify or any other service you want to use)?
