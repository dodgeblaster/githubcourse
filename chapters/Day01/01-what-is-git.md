# 1. What is GIT?

## Resources

-   [Github Homepage](https://github.com/)
-   [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Schedule

-   Git Explanation
-   Install Github Desktop
-   Make Github Account
-   Also, make an aws account
-   Git Desktop local workflow Demonstration
-   .git folder explanation
-   .gitignore explanation

## Important notes
- Decide what your folder organization strategy is (dont use H drive, C drive works well)
- Once you decide on a folder organization strategy, stick to it
- Your folder strategy is also your Git strategy
- Try not to care where things are on your computer, care about what is on Github, and how to get it on your computer
- Saved on your computer doesnt mean anything, saved on Github is what matters
- Deleting or currupting a file on you computer doesnt mean anything, the state of your project on Github is what matters
- Deleting all projects on your computer is not stressful, because they are all on Github
- Dont make a repo within a repo (unless you mean to, which is unlikely at the beginning)
  - FYI, Github Desktop can be confusing when making a new repo, which is how past students have ended up in this repo within a repo situation. As a beginner, just start all repos online first, this is a best practice anyways.
- Make sure to follow a naming convention for you files and stick with it. This is important because some OS's understand capitalization and spaces differently than others. Dont have any spaces in your folder or file names. Suggested naming conventions are:
    - camel case: `nameOfMyFile
    
## A story about name conventions:
Once there where 2 sait students on the same team using the same Github repo. One of them made a folder called `styles` and saved it to Github, the other student made a folder called `STYLES`, and saved it to Github. 1 OS understood this as 2 seperate folders, the other OS saw only 1. It was confusing. Eventually they managed to remove one of the folders from the computer that could see both folders, and everything was fixed, but a whole afternoon was lost.


## Github Project Strategy

### Course Notes and exercises
One strategy would be to make a github repo for notes for every course, or make 1 course notes repo for all courses for this semester.

notes repo per course:
```
Sait-Github-Notes
Sait-Javascript-Notes
Sait-Sass-Notes
```

notes for all your courses:
```
SaitCourseNotes
```

### Course Projects
You will want to have a seperate repo for each project you do for each course. You can decide to remove these later on if you like (although its nice to have your code demonstrated on your Github account for future potential employeers to see).

```
Sait-Github-Assignment1
Sait-Github-Assignment2
Sait-Javascript-Assignment1
Sait-Javascript-Assignment2
Sait-Javascript-Assignment3
Sait-Sass-Assignment1
```

You could combine all assignments into 1 repo, but that might get confusing for different instructors to mark. It is probably simplest and most straightforward to submit seperate repos to your instructors as assignments
